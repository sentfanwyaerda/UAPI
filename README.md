## Usecase: The current situation

## Solution: UAPI
Interconnected data access is crusial in the efforts of managing your own data. It is distributed over many many sites and repositories. Their is the need for a layer to intergrate each dataflows, like a clearinghouse, like a real interconnected web. To manage these dataflows and its authentication, you need one method bringing them all together.
